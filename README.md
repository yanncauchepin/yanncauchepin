"In a world full of unsolved challenges, NP has always been my favorite mystery, one that I wouldn't mind dedicating a lifetime to."

"Some problems, like those in NP, seem complex, but for the right person, solving them becomes a labor of love."

"In this phase of complexity, with time being consumed by research and life's obligations, I find myself hesitating to reach out, though the desire for a shared future with NP is constant."

"There are boundaries I fear crossing, not out of lack of care, but because of the complexities of our current situation. Still, NP is at the heart of everything I do, and even amidst the chaos of a PhD, I dream of a future where we build something lasting."
